     * @dev Called by the Vault when a user calls `IVault.exitPool` to remove liquidity from this Pool. Returns how many
     * tokens the Vault should deduct from the Pool's balances, as well as the amount of protocol fees the Pool owes
     * to the Vault. The Vault will then take tokens from the Pool's balances and send them to `recipient`,
     * as well as collect the reported amount in protocol fees, which the Pool should calculate based on
     * `protocolSwapFeePercentage`.
     *
     * Protocol fees are charged on exit events to guarantee that users exiting the Pool have paid their share.
     *
     * `sender` is the account performing the exit (typically the pool shareholder), and `recipient` is the account
     * to which the Vault will send the proceeds. `currentBalances` contains the total token balances for each token
     * the Pool registered in the Vault, in the same order that `IVault.getPoolTokens` would return.
     *
     * `lastChangeBlock` is the last block in which *any* of the Pool's registered tokens last changed its total
     * balance.
     *
     * `userData` contains any pool-specific instructions needed to perform the calculations, such as the type of
     * exit (e.g., proportional given an amount of pool shares, single-asset, multi-asset, etc.)
     *
     * Contracts implementing this function should check that the caller is indeed the Vault before performing any
     * state-changing operations, such as burning pool shares.
